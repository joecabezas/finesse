# Javascript Finesse trainer

## [Try it out](https://d-002.github.io/finesse)

## General

Place pieces one at a time where the grey shadow is.

You can change the pieces you want to train on, their positions and rotations by selecting or unselecting the colored letters and numbers in the Piece settings section. You must then apply and save your settings by clicking on the *Apply changes* button.

You can change your keybinds, DAS and ARR in the Keys settings menu.

Your total finesse errors, placed pieces, PPS are displayed, along with some finesse tips to help you improve.

Expect your PPS to be slower than usual, as there is no way to plan or to look ahead to the next piece placements.

## Mobile

This trainer has got a mobile version that reorganizes the screen and adds buttons to the bottom of the screen similarly to Jstris.
